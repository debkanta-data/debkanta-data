## 🏆 Signature Project:E-commerce Revenue & Customer Profitability (Olist)

> - **The Problem:** The business had **400,000+ raw transaction records** scattered across 8 disconnected tables, making it impossible to calculate real-time profitability or identify high-value users.

> - **The Solution:** Engineered an automated **Python ETL** pipeline to clean and normalize data into a MySQL Star Schema. Offloaded heavy **profitability calculations** to SQL Views for performance and applied **RFM Segmentation** via Python to **categorize users**.
